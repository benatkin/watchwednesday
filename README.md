# About

A project for sharing GitHub repos to watch on twitter.

Based upon [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/)'s [Watch Wednesday](http://thechangelog.com/post/1167855730/watchwednesday-20100922) project. Totally unofficial.

# Status

Incomplete. Currently there's one page, [http://watchwednesday.com/benatkin](http://watchwednesday.com/benatkin),
that gets tweets containing "benatkin" (or another username) and "watchwednesday.com", and displays them with links based on
the tweet format below.

# Tweet format
